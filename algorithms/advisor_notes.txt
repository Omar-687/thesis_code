llf a sllf v com sa lisia v tom co mam naprogramovane tu ideu nie vzorce co treba zmenit a pripadne ich porovnat

llf

traditional scheduling algorithm, can be applied to smart/adaptive charging
has unnecessary oscillations in charging rates
evs are sorted from smallest laxity to highest laxity
available capacity at time t P(t) is assigned to each ev, ev is charged up to
min(r_i,e_i(t)), the amount of energy we charge each ev with we call maximum feasible charging rate
which is calculated by bisection (zachary lee phd, acnsim, sllf books)
only concerned about finishing jobs (not cost minisation, load flattening, grid support)

how to use llf in combination with something to solve our optimisation problem
1. if we are able to predict P(t), we can balance charging depending on the price
2. charging rate value adjustement

based on llf
maximising minimum laxity for next timestep
uses 2. technique for improving llf
only concerned about finishing jobs (not cost minisation, load flattening, grid support)
